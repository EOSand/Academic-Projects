# [Ongoing - Constraints on Maximal Entanglement Under Groups of Permutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14507)
We provide a simplified characterization of entanglement in physical systems which are symmetric under the action of subgroups of the symmetric group acting on the party labels. Sets of entanglements are inherently equal, lying in the same orbit under the group action, which we demonstrate for cyclic, dihedral, and polyhedral groups. We then introduce new, generalized relationships for the maxima of those entanglement by exploiting the normalizer and normal subgroups of the physical symmetry group.

This paper was submitted to the arXiv for review in November of 2020, and is currently awaiting submission to _Physical Review A_.

# [08/2021 - Derivation of a Wave Function for Quantum Gravitation in 2-D](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Liberatore_Sanderson_Poster.pdf)
Quantum gravity is an active field of research, and thus we still utilize a variety of analytic solutions to find the metric _g_ for a given distribution of matter and energy, which is a solution to Einstein’s equations. We use a probability amplitude _Ψ_ which is a function of the space-like portion of _g_. This poster provides an overview of the research we have been conducting on the subject. In particular, we have focused on calculating complex integrals for possible wave functions and normalizing successfully calculated wave functions.

This poster was submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics at WIT in August of 2021.

# [12/2020 - Modern Algebra in Modern Music: Understanding sound through a methematical lens](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Modern_Algebra_Music.pdf)
Since its dawn, music has been a staple of every culture and every civilization, both consisting of humans and non-humans. Every musical genre can be primarily associated with specific cultures and each culture has its own primary genre and style; western music has different stylistic and modal properties than those of eastern music. Despite these distinctions, and as our society progressed into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we have begun to have access to many different genres, styles, and rhythms from nearly every culture via the internet. Now, anyone can explore and dive into any kind of music from anywhere in the world. Although the art of music is incredibly widespread and vast, the physical and mathematical mechanics behind the phenomenon are not completely understood by the average person. The aim of this paper is to explore both the linear algebra and further analysis behind the mechanics of sound in a concise, coherent way. Hopefully, after reading paper one will have a much clearer and formal understanding of the topics presented. 

This paper was submitted as a final assignment for Math 390 at Simmons University in December of 2020.

# [12/2019 - Fermat Numbers, Goldbach’s Theorem, and the Infinitude of Primes](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Fermat_Numbers_Poster.pdf)
This expository project analyzes the fundamentals of Fermat numbers, including special properties, Goldbach's theorem, and a proof that there
are infinitely many primes.

# [12/2019 - Free Groups](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Free_Groups.pdf)
First studied in 1924, a free group _F_S_ is a type of group that is considered to be free of relations. That is, it is constructed by a set 
of elements from a group _G_, denoted _S_ and its inverse set, _S<sup>-1</sup>_ in such a way that _F_S_/_N_ = _G_ where _N_ is a normal 
subgroup of _F_S_. Free groups have applications in group theory, category theory, topology, and other areas of mathematics.

# [12/2018 - SIR Model Using Vaccinations](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/SIR_with_Vaccinations.pdf)
In this paper we take the standard SIR model one step further and introduce a vaccination rate to measure the effects it has on the model.
Throughout class we have looked at examples of SIR models which all address the spread of a disease within a contained population given some 
disease length. Our work aimed to introduce a vaccination rate and study it's affect on the intensity and length of the epidemic. We 
introduced a daily vaccination rate of 15% which would be applied to susceptible individuals and cause the patient to become immune after 
three days.

# [10/2018 - Deflection of an electric beam](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Deflection_of_an_Electric_Beam.pdf)
This investigation aims to measure the deflection of an electron beam as it passes between a set of parallel charged plates. Using this 
measurement, we will be able to determine the electric field strength between the plates.

This report was submitted as a final paper for MATH 1750 at WIT in October of 2018.

# [05/2018 - Optimization: A method to expand binomials raised to the nth power](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Math_IA.pdf)
This investigation aims to find another way to express a binomial without using the binomial expansion. In other words, given a binomial with
positive terms and real power, is there a way to represent this expression with only powers of the terms inside the binomial? We use methods
of optimization and analyzing linear relationships to intuitively and rigorously achieve an expression for the expansion of an arbitrary
binomial. 

This project was submitted as a final assessment for IB HL Mathematics in May of 2018.

# [05/2018 - Finding an unknown variable based on the equation for launch angle](https://github.com/EOSand/Academic-Projects/blob/master/Physics_IA.pdf)
This investigation aims to determine the physical quantity and units of an unknown variable based on the kinematic equation for launch angle.
We notice that the equation for the launch angle of a given projectile, required to hit coordinates **(x,y)** when fired with initial velocity 
**v**, looks quite similar to the quadratic formula. We derive the corresponding quadratic equation from which the previous formula results
and conduct an experiment to nearly understand which physical property the resulting quadratic equation describes.
